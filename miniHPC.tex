	\begin{itemize}

		\item Hardware less abstract.
		\item Real system are busy doing actual research (85 - 95% load on systems).
		\item Fear amongst learners that they are going to break the multi-million system they are playing on.
		\item Resource limits more apparent.
		\item More control over the environment.
		\item No need to have accounts on a real HPC.
		\item Own access point, so no need to get people on university network.
